[ '--summarize', "$DATADIR/raw-logs/pulse-agent-idle.txt" ]
An unexpected error occurred, most likely due to no fault in the tested
code itself :(

Please point some CI administrator towards this problem.  Meanwhile, it
may be worthwhile to attempt the build again.

  Recipe terminated with an error: Agent idle before recipe expected to complete (agent: bq-mac-mini-16, recipe: 179080136, since ping: 2549, timeout: 2400)
