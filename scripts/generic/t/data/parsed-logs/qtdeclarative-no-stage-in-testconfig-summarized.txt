It seems that there has been some misconfiguration of the Pulse CI
tool, or some related CI infrastructure error. This is NOT the fault of
the code under test!

Please contact some CI administrator to resolve this problem.
Meanwhile, it may be worthwhile to attempt the build again.

   Could not find a stage directory for macx-g++ developer-build OSX 10.7 (looked at /Users/qt/.pulse2-agent/data/recipes/151223160/base/_testconfig/projects/Qt_Modules_Continuous_Integration/stages/macx-g++_developer-build_OSX_10.7, /Users/qt/.pulse2-agent/data/recipes/151223160/base/_testconfig/projects/QtDeclarative_master_Integration/stages/macx-g++_developer-build_OSX_10.7) at _testconfig/test.pl line 909.
